# ðŸ§  Multilayer ANN on Diabetes Dataset

A neural network project that predicts diabetes using a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built from scratch.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies a Multilayer ANN to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to classify whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters.

Key objectives:
- Build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train the model on real-world medical data
- Optimize performance using multiple layers and activation functions

## ðŸ§  Techniques & Tools

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Dense neural networks (fully connected layers)
- Data normalization
- ReLU, Sigmoid activations
- Binary cross-entropy loss

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

## ðŸ§ª Model Results

- Accuracy: ~80% (varies with tuning)
- Confusion matrix and classification report used for evaluation

## ðŸš€ Outcome

This project showcases my understanding of neural networks, preprocessing, and real-life medical data application in ML.
